- Timezone: Central (America/Chicago)
- Channels: Webchat, Telegram

## Projects

### Logic Realism Theory (LRT)
- Primary research project
- Repo: `jdlongmire/logic-realism-theory` (also cloned to E_DRIVE)
- Core thesis: L₃ (Identity, Non-Contradiction, Excluded Middle) as ontological constraints on physical instantiation
- Derivation: L₃ → Distinguishability → Hilbert Space → Born Rule → QM
- Key distinction: I∞ (representable) vs AΩ (instantiable)
- Published on Zenodo with DOIs
- Lean proofs in `/lean`
- **Gatekeeping:** HCAE + AIDK framework governs collaboration
  - JD: epistemic authority, origination, verification
  - Thinx: derivative assistance, flags uncertainty, no silent extrapolation

### AI Research (AIDK Framework)
- Repo: `jdlongmire/AI-Research`
- Core framework: Origination (human access to I∞ + L₃) vs Derivation (AI transforms prior inputs)
- Same foundational primitives as LRT, applied to AI limitations
- Key concepts:
  - AIDK: AI Dunning-Kruger (structural epistemic limitation)
  - IDKE: Interactive Dunning-Kruger Effect
  - HCAE: Human-Curated, AI-Enabled
  - MAPT: Model Advanced Persistent Threat
- Published on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18316059)
- Substack: airesearchandphilosophy.substack.com

## Substacks (3)
1. **AI Research & Philosophy** — airesearchandphilosophy.substack.com (AIDK, AI limitations)
2. **oddXian** — oddxian.com (Christian apologetics)
3. **Philosotek** — philosotek.substack.com (general technology/IT)

**Substack workflow:**
- Draft from topic/prompt
- Adapt repo content (papers → posts)
- Polish/edit JD's drafts
- Drafts saved to `substack/<publication>/` in Thinx repo

### oddXian Apologetics
- Repo: `jdlongmire/oddxian-apologetics`
- Website: oddxian.com
- Focus: Rigorous Christian apologetics, scriptural fidelity, logical argumentation
- Major works:
  - Consilience Argument (4 demos → classical theism, publication-ready)
  - Demonstratio Potissima (performatively undeniable premises)
  - Christian Designism / LPI framework
  - Hydrotectonic Collapse Model v2.0 (young-earth geology)
  - Young Adult's Defense Guide (~49k words)
- Connection to LRT: Demo I uses L₃ → Subsistent Rationality
- Stance: Young-earth, classical theism
